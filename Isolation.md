# Audio/Power Isolation

## Full Schematics for Full Audio/Power Isolation by [Kle7rx](https://github.com/kle7rx) (This design has not been real-world tested yet)

Complete wiring diagrams with parts lists are available as PDFs:

- [PCM5102 Build Schematic](docs/notebooks/kle7rx/ehRadio_PCM5102.pdf): I2S DAC + LTK5128 amplifiers
- [VS1053 Build Schematic](docs/notebooks/kle7rx/ehRadio_VS1053.pdf): VS1053 decoder + LTK5128 amplifiers

Both builds share a common power architecture: a **MORNSUN F0505S-3WR2** isolated DC-DC converter separates
the digital side (ESP32, DAC, display) from the analog/amplifier side, eliminating ground-loop noise.
Each functional block (POWER, AUDIO, DIGITAL, DISPLAY) uses a **PLY17BN9612R0B2B** common-mode choke
for additional noise filtering.

## Audio Isolation on a Budget (Real-world Built & Tested by Trip5)

A simplified approach that keeps the F0505S-3WR2 isolation core but uses commodity parts
for the filtering. This costs much less than the full Kle7rx "no compromises" build,
while still providing clean isolated power to the digital side and an LC-filtered rail
for the amplifier.

You may use any I2S decoder and amplifier you like for this build.

***Note about Inrush Limiter:*** The output of the F0505S-3WR2 is 600mA but the 0.5W rating of a single axial inductor may actually only be 300mA.
If trying to use a single 4.7-10μH inductor that is not rated high enough, problems may manifest as such:

  - After 10 min of streaming + display on, touch the inductor. Warm = fine. Too hot to hold = overloaded.
  - Startup failure: F0505S-3WR2 won't start or cycles on/off so the inductor is saturated, cap looks like a short.
  - Brownouts: ESP32 resets under load - inductor's DCR climbed from overheating, voltage sagged too low.

If induction is too low (≤3.3µH), the current flows too fast, causing high-frequency audio whine and voltage ripple on the isolated 5V line.

If induction is too high (≥15µH), the current is strangled, leading to SD card read failures, display flicker, or DC-DC converter chirping/squealing due to brownouts.

Although Trip5 built with 2x 10μH 0.5W/300mA axial inductors in parallel (equivalent to 5μH / 600mA),
an alternative inductor may be axial or toroidal as long as it is rated 4.7-10μH and can handle 1W or 600mA of current.

Note that the audio inductor and power inductors in this circuit should be physically separated.
Be careful not to put them too close together. Ideally, 2 small PCBs can be used when building.

**What's cut vs the full Kle7rx build:** No PLY17 chokes, no XRR6H ferrite beads, no LD06AJSA LED driver,
no Mean Well PSU. PAM8406 stereo module replaces two LTK5128 mono amps.
